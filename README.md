# Plans made with PlanExe

## US-Mexico canal

US-Mexico canal. I want to build a canal along USA's southern border to mexico, so that containers no longer have to go all the way to Panama. Also this would help with southern border security.

## Global language

I'm envisioning a streamlined global languageâ€”free of archaic features like gendered terms and excessive suffixes, taking cues from LLM tokenization. Some regions might only choose to adopt certain parts of this modern language. Would humanity ultimately benefit more from preserving many distinct languages, or uniting around a single, optimized one?

## Puzzle restaurant

I want to make a restaurant for puzzle solving happy people. An important part is that humans are solving puzzles with each other. While having something to drink and eat.
