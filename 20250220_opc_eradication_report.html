Assign a current team member (perhaps the Eradication Team Coordinator or Public Communication Liaison) to dedicate a portion of their time to volunteer management. This includes creating a volunteer schedule, providing necessary training, and acting as a point of contact for questions and concerns.</p>
<h2>2. First Aid/Medical Support</h2>
<p>Given the risk of exposure to toxic hairs and potential allergic reactions, having someone with first aid training readily available is crucial. The plan mentions stockpiling antihistamines and corticosteroids, but not a trained person to administer them.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:
Ensure at least one member of each Eradication Team is certified in first aid and CPR, with specific training on managing allergic reactions. This person should be responsible for administering first aid and coordinating with emergency medical services if needed.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Potential Improvements</h1>
<h2>1. Clarify Responsibilities of Eradication Team Coordinator</h2>
<p>The description of the Eradication Team Coordinator is broad. Specifying their responsibilities regarding communication with other roles (e.g., Safety &amp; Compliance Officer, Equipment &amp; Logistics Manager) will improve coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:
Add specific responsibilities to the Eradication Team Coordinator's description, such as 'Daily communication with the Safety &amp; Compliance Officer regarding safety protocols' and 'Weekly meetings with the Equipment &amp; Logistics Manager to anticipate equipment needs.'</p>
<h2>2. Formalize Communication Channels</h2>
<p>While the Public Communication Liaison is responsible for external communication, internal communication channels between team members are not explicitly defined. This can lead to delays and misunderstandings.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:
Establish a clear communication protocol, specifying how different team members should communicate with each other (e.g., daily briefings, weekly progress reports, emergency contact procedures). Utilize a shared communication platform (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) to facilitate information sharing.</p>
<h2>3. Define Success Metrics for Each Role</h2>
<p>While the project has overall success criteria, individual roles lack specific, measurable goals. Defining these metrics will improve accountability and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:
Develop key performance indicators (KPIs) for each role. For example, the Infestation Mapping &amp; Survey Lead could be measured by the accuracy and completeness of the infestation map, while the Safety &amp; Compliance Officer could be measured by the number of safety incidents reported.</p>
