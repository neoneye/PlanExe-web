# Featured Use Case

## Silo

Inspired by the [TV series "Silo"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/).

Construct a massive, multi-level underground complex designed to sustain thousands of people indefinitely. This silo would feature self-contained ecosystems, including residential areas, agricultural zones, and industrial facilities spread across 144 floors. The structure would maintain stringent rules to keep order and control information about the outside world, believed to be toxic. Advanced surveillance and security systems would enforce these rules. The silo would be a complete, self-sustaining society, with its own power generation, water recycling, and air filtration systems, embodying a dystopian, controlled environment. Funding for this project comes from a mix of government allocations and private investments from elite stakeholders.
