## Silo

Inspired by the [TV series "Silo"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/).

Construct a massive, multi-level underground complex designed to sustain thousands of people indefinitely. This silo would feature self-contained ecosystems, including residential areas, agricultural zones, and industrial facilities spread across 144 floors. The structure would maintain stringent rules to keep order and control information about the outside world, believed to be toxic. Advanced surveillance and security systems would enforce these rules. The silo would be a complete, self-sustaining society, with its own power generation, water recycling, and air filtration systems, embodying a dystopian, controlled environment. Funding for this project comes from a mix of government allocations and private investments from elite stakeholders.

## Robot Olympics

It's 2025 and humanoid robots are entering mainstream society, with China already showcasing robotic athletes in sports events. Plan a 2026 Robot Olympics, outline innovative events, rules, and challenges to test the humanoid robots.

## Rust OS

Make a 64bit x86 OS in Rust. Linux-like but not POSIX-compliant. Monolithic kernel, memory management, process scheduler, shell, utils (ls, cat, rm, mkdir, mv, rmdir, ps). Basic drivers for console, disk, and virtio-net, and include enough network stack do a ping. This is my hobby project for testing LLM coding skills.

## Dead fish

Launch a pollution monitoring program for Roskilde Fjord in Roskilde, Denmark, in response to alarming fish die-offs. Track oxygen levels, nutrients, microplastics, pH, nitrates, and phosphates in real time.

## Clean water

Implement a comprehensive strategy for providing clean water to areas where it is currently unavailable. Your solution should include infrastructure development for water purification, distribution, and ongoing maintenance, and clarify if you are upgrading existing systems or building new ones from scratch. Assume this project will serve 2 million people in rural areas over 3 years with a total budget of 200 million USD.

## OPC Eradication

Eradication of Oak Processionary Caterpillars. It was discovered in Denmark for the first time just under three weeks ago, with around 800 nests found in trees in southeastern Odense. You suffocate from the caterpillar’s toxic hairs.
Limit the outbreak as quick as possible.

## Arxiv distillation

Distill Arxiv papers into an objective, hype-free summary that indicates whether improvements are truly significant or just noise. Compare claims with benchmarks, flag inflated gains, and foster a clear, evidence-based understanding of machine learning progress without marketing language. To make the distilled data available with minimal upkeep and maximum longevity, publish these summaries as an open-access dataset on a well-established repository.

## Puzzle restaurant

I want to make a restaurant for puzzle solving happy people. An important part is that humans are solving puzzles with each other. While having something to drink and eat.

## Global language

I'm envisioning a streamlined global language—free of archaic features like gendered terms and excessive suffixes, taking cues from LLM tokenization. Some regions might only choose to adopt certain parts of this modern language. Would humanity ultimately benefit more from preserving many distinct languages, or uniting around a single, optimized one?

## US-Mexico canal

US-Mexico canal. I want to build a canal along USA's southern border to mexico, so that containers no longer have to go all the way to Panama. Also this would help with southern border security.
