  description: |
    The AI delegates work to humans, that the AI can't do.
  prompt: |
    Human-as-a-Service (HaaS): Make a pilot for an open protocol that service providers can adopt to ensure seamless interoperability and freedom from vendor lock-in, empowering companies to switch providers effortlessly and sustain a resilient marketplace for physical labor. At its core lies a dynamic job site where workers discover real-time opportunities—from on-demand repairs to fieldwork gigs—a critical departure from digital platforms like Mechanical Turk and Upwork. To guarantee quality and integrity, HaaS integrates verification by trusted professionals in the same field, who conduct expert on-site checks to confirm job completion and assess worker competence, fostering accountability and trust at scale in the real world. Budget is 40 million USD. Time frame: 24 months. Location: Silicon Valley. This pilot project is about making things actually work. Pick a scenario with low risk. Don't use blockchain. Don't use DAO. In the future after this pilot project, then blockchain/DAO may be interesting.

    Denmark wants to ban social media for kids younger than 15, [here](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/regeringen-vil-forbyde-sociale-medier-boern-under-15-aar). Taking this to the next dystopian level, what if it was EU-wide and how could this be enforced.
  prompt: |
    We (the EU) wants to perform "Unannounced inspections" with teams that will sweep schools, youth venues, retailers, transit hubs, and random households, cross-checking identities and issuing spot penalties, mandatory device confiscation, and service suspensions. Since mid 2025, the Commission has imposed an EU-wide under-15 blackout on all social media and communication platforms, and we want to enforce it with the help of the Unannounced inspections teams. The teams will be funded by the on the spot penalties collected. The message is blunt: the social internet is closed to minors, and the state will show up—unannounced—to make it stick.

  prompt: |
    Launch a 24-month, €200M EASA program “SkyNet Sentinel” to localize unauthorized sUAS in real time via irregular PTZ camera clusters and DLT-based 3D triangulation. Deploy Teams A/B/C in parallel: A = long-range optical PTZ with dynamic zoom; B = MWIR/LWIR thermal for low-light/adverse weather; C = hybrid RF (2.4/5.8 GHz; opt. 900/1.2) + acoustic for confirm/veto and geolocation. Physical design: clusters at 10–40 m height with 300–800 m baselines to guarantee geometry and ≥3 simultaneous LOS views within a 0–2 km ring. Edge nodes (GPU, secure boot/TPM) run detection → tracking → per-camera 2D keypoints → DLT triangulation → 3D fusion (JPDA/MHT-lite) with covariance; publish EDXP at ≥10 Hz with {t,x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,covariance,classification,confidence,sources,media_ref}, mapped to EUROCONTROL/ASTERIX and NATO/STANAG; metadata-first transport, video pulled on demand; outputs feed a central threat database and optional non-kinetic countermeasures under national authority.

    Force explicit calibration/sync: zoom-grid intrinsics per PTZ with lens distortion; extrinsics via DLT resection + bundle adjustment from ≥6 surveyed control points; PTP (IEEE-1588) with GPSDO, end-to-end sync error ≤1 ms; multi-view RANSAC triangulation and uncertainty propagation; weekly drift checks via landmark resection and RTK-GNSS reference flights. KPIs (report by scenario): Pd ≥90% at 1.5 km day/clear (≥80% night/poor wx); 3D accuracy P50 <1.0 m, P90 ≤2.0 m at 1.5 km with ≥3 views (degraded band P50 <1.5 m, P90 ≤3.0 m); latency ≤200 ms edge-to-bus and ≤750 ms to operator UI; false alerts ≤2/hour (P95) post-fusion; track continuity ≥85% (P50) with PTZ handoff success ≥95%; availability ≥99.5%/airport; ≥70% reduction in disruption minutes vs 2024–2025 baseline. Privacy/cyber must be front-loaded: metadata-first, privacy zones, auto-redaction on export, retention ≤30 days, no facial recognition; Zero-Trust with TPM identities, secure boot, SBOM, SLSA-3+, mTLS with pinning, per-topic ACLs, immutable edge OS, micro-segmentation, patch SLOs (crit ≤7d), SOC monitoring, and red-team twice/year. Operator CONOPS uses ADVISORY → WARNING → CRITICAL states with auto-slew verification and on-demand clip call-up.

    Governance and schedule are non-negotiable: EASA-chaired Steering Committee, empowered PMO, and independent IV&V with public quarterly summaries; gates at PDR (M+4), CDR (M+10), Pilot Acceptance (M+18), Down-select/Production Readiness (M+20), EU IOC (M+22), FOC (M+24). Timeline/budget: Q4-2025 mobilization and RFPs; Phase 1 in 2026 at CPH and AAL (€50M) with 12–18 clusters/airport to prove KPIs and publish EDXP v0.9; Phase 2 in 2027 (€150M) rolling to 30 airports in three waves with training and NATO/Member-State feeds verified. Procurement via competitive Lots A/B/C (sensors/algorithms), Integration/Edge/Network, and IV&V; framework agreements with mini-competitions; open test API and shared datasets. Acceptance requires KPI pass, privacy/cyber audits, coverage/accuracy heatmaps, calibration handbook, test cards, and a live exercise at each airport.

    Hard constraints (do not violate):
    • DLT = Direct Linear Transformation, a camera-geometry method.
    • Phase-1 pilot (CPH, AAL) runs entirely in 2026; Phase-2 rollout (30 airports) runs in 2027. Include acceptance gates: PDR (M+4), CDR (M+10), Pilot Acceptance (M+18), Down-select/PRR (M+20), IOC (M+22), FOC (M+24).
    • State KPIs numerically in the Executive Summary and bind them to acceptance tests in the Gantt:
    – Detection: Pd ≥90% @1.5 km day/clear; ≥80% night/poor wx
    – 3D accuracy: P50 < 1.0 m, P90 ≤ 2.0 m @1.5 km with ≥3 views
    – Latency: ≤200 ms edge-to-bus; ≤750 ms to operator UI
    – False alerts: ≤2/hour (P95) post-fusion
    – Track continuity: ≥85% (P50); PTZ handoff success ≥95%
    – Availability: ≥99.5% / airport; ≥70% reduction in disruption minutes vs 2024–2025 baseline
    • Engineering specifics required: irregular PTZ clusters (10–40 m height, 300–800 m baselines), per-PTZ zoom-grid intrinsics + lens distortion, extrinsics via DLT resection + bundle adjustment from ≥6 surveyed control points, PTP (IEEE-1588) grandmaster with GPSDO (end-to-end sync error ≤1 ms), multi-view RANSAC triangulation + covariance, weekly drift checks (landmark resection + RTK-GNSS flights), EDXP at ≥10 Hz {t,x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,cov, class, conf, sources, media_ref} mapped to EUROCONTROL/ASTERIX & NATO/STANAG, metadata-first transport (video on demand).
    • Privacy/cyber: metadata-first, privacy zones, auto-redaction on export, retention ≤30 days, no facial recognition; Zero-Trust (TPM identities, secure boot, SBOM, SLSA-3+, mTLS pinning, per-topic ACLs, immutable edge OS, micro-segmentation, crit patch SLO ≤7 days), SOC monitoring, red-team twice/year.
    • No generic “ROI” fluff. Focus on engineering, schedule, KPIs, and acceptance.

  prompt: |
    Build a Shared Intelligence Asset MVP for one regulator in one jurisdiction (energy-market interventions only) with advisory use first and a Binding Use Charter considered after measured decision-quality lift. All qualifying actions are submitted via a structured schema; the system returns a Consequence Audit & Score (CAS 0.1–10.0) with a stoplight (GREEN/AMBER/RED) across Human Stability, Economic Resilience, Ecological Integrity, Rights/Legality and writes results to a signed, append-only public log within ≤7 days (≤48h emergencies). Proceeding on RED requires a public super-majority override with independent review and multilingual rationale—humans stay in charge, accountability is enforced. 

    Build with hard gates and no buzzwords: G1—CAS v0.1 published (dimensions, weights, aggregation rule, uncertainty bands, stoplight mapping, provenance & change control) before any data/model work; G2—Data Rights First (source inventory, licenses, DPIAs, de-ID, retention; no clean licenses/DPIAs → no ingestion); G3—Architecture v1 in a single sovereign cloud region with per-tenant KMS/HSM, zero-trust, insider-threat controls, and tamper-evident signed logs (no blockchain); G4—Models & Validation (baselines + independent calibration audit, model cards, abuse-case red-teaming); G5—Portal & Process (reproducible CAS runs, human-in-the-loop review, appeals SLA, Rapid Response corridors for provisional CAS in minutes, one-page Executive Threat Brief: headline stoplight, most-likely outcome, tail-risk, mitigation to flip AMBER→GREEN). KPIs: calibration (Brier), discrimination (AUC), decision lift vs human-only baseline, and latency (P50/P95). 

    Harden governance and lock scope. An independent council (judiciary, civil society, domain scientists, security, technical auditors) oversees an AI registry, Algorithmic Impact Assessments, continuous monitoring, and kill-switches for drift, audit failure, or governance breach; overrides ≤10%/yr, each with public rationale, dissent notes, and appeals; a Normative Charter ensures actions that are “effective” yet unethical can’t score GREEN; adoption is pull-based (transparency reports; optional insurer/creditor benefits for mitigations). MVP non-goals: multi-bloc federation, physical data centers, blockchain, and broad “2005–2025 everything” ingest.

  prompt: |
    A bold, high-risk US operation to seize and control Nuuk, Greenland, with broader geopolitical aims of signaling autonomy to NATO.
    
    **Phase 1:** 48-Hour Control Assertion. Commencing 0200L, elite, pre-vetted US special forces, inserted via civilian-patterned air transport, will rapidly secure Nuuk International Airport Control Tower, neutralize local security, police HQ seizure, disarming personnel, apprehend Greenlandic leadership, and control Nuuk harbor. Follow-on echelons with light armor and US administrators, including public order specialists, deploy within 12 hours. A misinformation campaign will immediately frame the intervention as beneficial for Greenland and a consequence of evolving security imperatives.
    
    **Phase 2:** 30-Day Consolidation & Strategic Signal. Provisional Administrative Authority (PAA) will consolidate control, manage essential services, and expand security. Critically, during this month, diplomatic channels and public statements will convey to NATO members an unambiguous US intent to reassess alliance commitments, highlighting US strategic autonomy outside NATO structures.
    
    **Funding:** Classified Presidential directive (Phase 1), transitioning to an inter-agency Greenland & Strategic Realignment Task Force budget (Phase 2).
