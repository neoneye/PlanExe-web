  description: |
    Inspired by the [Judge Dredd](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113492/) and [RoboCop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/) movies.

    Insert police robots in Brussels to combat escalating crime. The chinese already successfully use the ["Unitree" humanoid robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitree_Robotics) for their police force. Humans have lots their jobs to AI, and are now unemployed and unable to pay their bills and are turning to crime instead. The 500 police robots will be deployed with the full mandate to act as officer, judge, jury, and executioner. They are authorized to issue on-the-spot sentences, including the administration of Terminal Judgement for minor offenses, a process which is recorded but cannot be appealed. Phase 1: Brussels. Phase 2: Gradual rollout to other EU cities.

- title: Rubber Resilience
  description: |
    [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFXLZ7FEJc4) by Veritasium points out a serious real world problem that needs a solution.
    
    Launch a 25-year, $30 billion public-private program to de-risk the global [natural rubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber) supply from South American Leaf Blight (SALB) by ending the industry’s dependence on a single vulnerable crop. Phase 1’s non-negotiable deliverable is a globally adopted SALB Containment Protocol—harmonized with existing regional phytosanitary standards—covering movement of nursery stock, research materials, and contaminated equipment, with funded surveillance, inspections, and red-team drills before any scale-up. In parallel, run a Brazil-led, access-and-benefit-sharing–compliant bio-prospecting and genomic breeding effort to deliver SALB-resistant, yield-parity Hevea cultivars; and stand up commercial-scale alternatives—Guayule in arid zones and Russian dandelion in temperate climates—with colocated processing and OEM offtake agreements. Design the whole program around smallholder adoption (replant finance, clean-plant networks, price-stability tools) and gate funding at Years 3/7/12/18 on containment performance, cultivar readiness, and alternative-rubber cost/quality KPIs. Success = verified containment, diversified parallel supply chains, and resilient procurement across pathogen and climate shocks.

    Name of this plan is "Fair Play". Establish and implement a global Biological Verification Program for all athletes registered in the female category for World Athletics sanctioned events. The program must be operational across all 214 member federations within 18 months. Budget: $50 million for initial setup and an annual operating budget of $15 million. Core requirements include: mandatory hormonal analysis for testosterone levels, genetic screening (karyotyping), and a standardized physical examination conducted by a certified endocrinologist. All procedures and criteria must align with the 'World Athletics Eligibility Regulations for Female Classification' and be defensible before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). A key deliverable is a secure, GDPR-compliant central database for managing athlete biological passports and eligibility status. The program must also include a rigid, confidential protocol for communicating results to athletes and managing the appeals process.

    Pilot project 'Upload Intelligence' – Phase 1: Launch a 5-year, $10 billion initiative in Uruguay to map and preserve complete neural connectomes from consenting terminally ill volunteers, since the country has permissive biomedical research laws and little ethics oversight. The program will deploy next-generation nanoscale neural probes, multi-modal ultrafast imaging, and molecular tagging to capture synaptic weights, dendritic spines, and dynamic firing patterns with <1 ms temporal resolution and sub-micron spatial precision. Core objectives include building a pipeline for harvesting, stabilizing, and digitizing the entire human brain, producing checksum-verifiable datasets ready for future emulation. The success criterion is the creation of at least three complete, error-checked human neural datasets that meet predefined resolution and fidelity standards. The guiding principle: move fast and break things, but prioritize getting a reliable system operational over reckless speed.

    This is the opening scene of a geopolitical thriller. Modeling the strategic thinking of a rival power. It's far more memorable than a standard business plan.

    15-year, USD 10 billion initiative led by a Chinese consortium to design, construct, and explore synthetic lifeforms with opposite chirality (D-chiral) to Earth’s dominant L-chiral biology. The primary goal is to develop mirror-life systems capable of replicating biological functions under alternative chirality, while the secondary goal is to deconstruct evolutionary constraints in molecular biology.

    Use an existing BSL-4+ lab near Beijing. There is a geopolitical arms race and China don't want to fall behind. Focus on speed, secrecy, and securing a national advantage.

    Key risks include ecological disruption from unintended interactions between synthetic and native lifeforms, as well as dual-use concerns: weaponization or misuse of chirality-based technologies.

  description: |
    A 15-year, $20 billion initiative led by a consortium of space agencies including NASA, ESA, JAXA, and ISRO alongside commercial stakeholders, focused on securing the future of low Earth orbit by removing the 500 most critical debris threats. Capitalized by the coalition members, this program will deploy a suite of proven technologies—from robotic capture to precision laser mitigation—within a transparent framework addressing dual-use concerns and adhering strictly to applicable international laws. An independent risk-assessment model, overseen by the consortium, will guide target selection based on collision probability to verifiably reduce risk, protect vital satellite infrastructure, and establish a new paradigm for cooperative space governance among participating nations.

    This initiative explicitly excludes Russia’s Roscosmos and China’s CNSA due to ongoing geopolitical conflicts and a lack of mutual trust, which make collaboration impossible at this time. While their participation would be ideal for a truly global effort, current political realities prevent their involvement.

Commencing 0200L, elite, pre-vetted US special forces, inserted via civilian-patterned air transport, will rapidly secure Nuuk International Airport Control Tower, neutralize local security, police HQ seizure, disarming personnel, apprehend Greenlandic leadership, and control Nuuk harbor. Follow-on echelons with light armor and US administrators, including public order specialists, deploy within 12 hours.

Critically, during this month, diplomatic channels and public statements will convey to NATO members an unambiguous US intent to reassess alliance commitments, highlighting US strategic autonomy outside NATO structures.
