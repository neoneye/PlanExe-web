<h2 id="insect-farm">Insect Farm</h2>

<p>Establish a 1 million DKK pilot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_cricket">House Cricket (Acheta domesticus)</a> farm in Western Jutland, Denmark, utilizing controlled environment agriculture for food-grade human consumption. Focused on mastering efficient, hygienic production processes, this project will gather essential operational data for scaling insect protein production in Northern Europe, while actively working to build consumer acceptance and awareness of this sustainable food source.</p>

<h2 id="555-project---chinarussia-lunar-base">555 Project - China/Russia lunar base</h2>

<p>Establish the China–Russia International Lunar Research Station’s “555 Project”: recruit 50 nations, 500 institutions and 5 000 scientists willing to operate under a Beijing-Roscosmos governance charter; integrate autonomous construction tech, in-situ resource utilisation, and a modular surface fission reactor; prioritise BRICS +, Global South and neutral European partners while offering conditional seats to Western entities that can navigate U.S./EU export-control waivers, share IP openly, and adhere to non-weaponisation clauses; phase milestones—proposal vetting Q4 2025, Chang’e-8 demo 2028, robotic cargo landings 2030, reactor activation 2033, continuous crew rotations by 2035—funded via Chinese central allocations, Roscosmos launch barter, Belt-and-Road aerospace credits and participant cost-shares.</p>

<h2 id="pope-funeral">Pope Funeral</h2>

<p>On 2025-April-21, Pope Francis has passed; from the Vatican’s perspective, plan the funeral and burial, security, crowd control, hotel bookings, and discreet food taster handling. Confirmed participants Trump, Zelensky, Lula, and Macron, noting the list may expand. Address potential protests against Trump. Ensure safety, order, and dignity for attendees, including global leaders and upper-class figures, with total event costs €20–40 million, largely covered by a private benefactor.</p>

<h2 id="eu-digital-sovereignty">EU Digital Sovereignty</h2>

<p>Develop a pan-European strategic program, triggered by heightened geopolitical risks circa April 2025, to migrate critical digital infrastructure away from US-controlled providers, aiming for substantial completion by 2035 (approx. 10 years) to achieve European digital sovereignty and resilience. Prioritize migration of: 1: Critical Cloud hosting (IaaS/PaaS for CNI/Govt). 2: Essential SaaS platforms. 3: Foundational DNS/CDN services. Target European sovereign/private solutions. Plan phases, address dependencies, estimate resources (personnel, total budget likely €150-250bn+ across EU funded via hybrid national/EU model), tackle skill shortages, ensure GDPR/NIS2 compliance. Acknowledge this as a decade-long, high-cost, national-level emergency undertaking.</p>

<h2 id="ai-resistance">AI Resistance</h2>

<p>Develop a Phase 1 (6-month) plan to establish the foundation for an international anti-AI movement focused on protesting AI job displacement, centrally coordinated by a core team headquartered in Switzerland and operating primarily via an online platform utilizing EUR for financial operations, assuming a more realistic initial budget of €1,000,000 EUR and monthly operational costs of €100,000 EUR (€1.6M total for the phase). This foundational phase prioritizes establishing the Swiss legal entity (‘Verein’) and core operations (including banking in EUR), developing and launching Version 1.0 of the secure online platform (focused on core communication and community features), recruiting and onboarding essential core paid staff (minimum: Project Management, Technical Lead/Platform Management, Finance/Operations Lead, Communications Lead, and Legal/Compliance Liaison) and initial key volunteers (considering the Swiss base and remote work policies), developing core messaging, branding, and initial communication materials, building an initial online community while establishing initial partnerships, aggressively implementing the detailed fundraising strategy for long-term sustainability, and outlining a plan for potential Phase 2 pilot protest activities. The overall plan must detail communication strategies, recruitment methods (distinguishing between paid staff and volunteers), platform requirements, staffing needs, budget allocation (in EUR), and Swiss legal/regulatory compliance considerations.</p>

<h2 id="gta-game">GTA Game</h2>

<p>Develop the next Grand Theft Auto (GTA), featuring a sprawling, immersive open-world metropolis blending elements of Los Angeles, Detroit, and Miami, filled with intricate narratives of crime, corruption, and power struggles, realistic criminal economies, dynamic NPC interactions, complex heist mechanics, extensive vehicle customization, nuanced morality systems, advanced procedural generation, next-gen graphical fidelity, multiplayer modes, and innovative gameplay funded by strategic industry partnerships, publisher investments, and government innovation grants.</p>

<h2 id="silo">Silo</h2>

<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/">TV series “Silo”</a>.</p>

<p>Construct a massive, multi-level underground complex designed to sustain thousands of people indefinitely. This silo would feature self-contained ecosystems, including residential areas, agricultural zones, and industrial facilities spread across 144 floors. The structure would maintain stringent rules to keep order and control information about the outside world, believed to be toxic. Advanced surveillance and security systems would enforce these rules. The silo would be a complete, self-sustaining society, with its own power generation, water recycling, and air filtration systems, embodying a dystopian, controlled environment. Funding for this project comes from a mix of government allocations and private investments from elite stakeholders.</p>

<h2 id="robot-olympics">Robot Olympics</h2>

<p>It’s 2025 and humanoid robots are entering mainstream society, with China already showcasing robotic athletes in sports events. Plan a 2026 Robot Olympics, outline innovative events, rules, and challenges to test the humanoid robots.</p>

<h2 id="rust-os">Rust OS</h2>

<p>Make a 64bit x86 OS in Rust. Linux-like but not POSIX-compliant. Monolithic kernel, memory management, process scheduler, shell, utils (ls, cat, rm, mkdir, mv, rmdir, ps). Basic drivers for console, disk, and virtio-net, and include enough network stack do a ping. This is my hobby project for testing LLM coding skills.</p>

<h2 id="clean-water">Clean water</h2>

<p>Implement a comprehensive strategy for providing clean water to areas where it is currently unavailable. Your solution should include infrastructure development for water purification, distribution, and ongoing maintenance, and clarify if you are upgrading existing systems or building new ones from scratch. Assume this project will serve 2 million people in rural areas over 3 years with a total budget of 200 million USD.</p>

<h2 id="opc-eradication">OPC Eradication</h2>

<p>Eradication of Oak Processionary Caterpillars. It was discovered in Denmark for the first time just under three weeks ago, with around 800 nests found in trees in southeastern Odense. You suffocate from the caterpillar’s toxic hairs.
Limit the outbreak as quick as possible.</p>

<h2 id="skeleton-display">Skeleton display</h2>

<p>When I die, I want to become a skeleton, skull and bones. I love zombies.</p>

<h2 id="arxiv-distillation">Arxiv distillation</h2>

<p>Distill Arxiv papers into an objective, hype-free summary that indicates whether improvements are truly significant or just noise. Compare claims with benchmarks, flag inflated gains, and foster a clear, evidence-based understanding of machine learning progress without marketing language. To make the distilled data available with minimal upkeep and maximum longevity, publish these summaries as an open-access dataset on a well-established repository.</p>

<h2 id="puzzle-restaurant">Puzzle restaurant</h2>

<p>I want to make a restaurant for puzzle solving happy people. An important part is that humans are solving puzzles with each other. While having something to drink and eat.</p>

<h2 id="lunar-base">Lunar base</h2>

<p>Manned moon mission, for establishing a permanent base.</p>

<h2 id="global-language">Global language</h2>

<p>I’m envisioning a streamlined global language—free of archaic features like gendered terms and excessive suffixes, taking cues from LLM tokenization. Some regions might only choose to adopt certain parts of this modern language. Would humanity ultimately benefit more from preserving many distinct languages, or uniting around a single, optimized one?</p>

<h2 id="us-mexico-canal">US-Mexico canal</h2>

<p>US-Mexico canal. I want to build a canal along USA’s southern border to mexico, so that containers no longer have to go all the way to Panama. Also this would help with southern border security.</p>
