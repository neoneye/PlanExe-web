<p><strong>What</strong>: Advise on the 'Design Water Purification System' and 'Plan Distribution Network Construction' sections of the pre-project assessment, as well as the 'Implementation of SCADA system' strength in the SWOT analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Water Purification, Water Distribution, Infrastructure Development, SCADA Systems, Project Management</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong>: Water Resource Engineer water purification distribution</p>
<h2>2.1 Primary Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Immediately engage a SCADA specialist, a hydraulic modeling expert, and a financial expert with experience in water utility management.</li>
<li>Develop a detailed SCADA system plan, a hydraulic model of the water distribution network, and a long-term financial sustainability plan.</li>
<li>Conduct a willingness-to-pay survey to determine appropriate water tariff levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.2 Secondary Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review case studies of successful SCADA implementations, water distribution network designs, and community-based water management models in similar rural areas.</li>
<li>Consult industry best practices from AWWA and ASCE.</li>
<li>Negotiate fixed-price contracts with suppliers and contractors to mitigate the risk of budget overruns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.3 Follow Up Consultation</h2>
<p>Discuss the detailed SCADA system plan, the hydraulic model of the water distribution network, and the long-term financial sustainability plan. Review the results of the willingness-to-pay survey and discuss appropriate water tariff levels.</p>
<h2>2.4.A Issue - Inadequate SCADA System Planning</h2>
<p>The project plan mentions a SCADA system for monitoring, but lacks detail. A SCADA system is not just for 'monitoring'. It's a critical component for efficient operation, predictive maintenance, and rapid response to water quality or distribution issues. The current plan doesn't specify what parameters will be monitored (flow, pressure, chlorine residual, turbidity, pH, etc.), the frequency of data collection, the communication infrastructure, or the alarm thresholds. Without these details, the SCADA system will be ineffective and the project will be exposed to significant operational risks.</p>
<h3>2.4.B Tags</h3>
<ul>
<li>SCADA</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Risk</li>
<li>Operations</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.4.C Mitigation</h3>
<p>Immediately engage a SCADA specialist with experience in water distribution networks. This consultant should define the SCADA system requirements, including sensor selection, communication protocols (cellular, satellite, etc.), data storage, and alarm management. Review case studies of successful SCADA implementations in similar rural water distribution projects. Provide the consultant with detailed maps of the proposed distribution network and anticipated water demand profiles. Read industry best practices from AWWA (American Water Works Association) on SCADA implementation.</p>
<h3>2.4.D Consequence</h3>
<p>Inefficient water distribution, delayed response to contamination events, increased operational costs, and potential system failures.</p>
<h3>2.4.E Root Cause</h3>
<p>Lack of in-house expertise in SCADA systems and insufficient upfront planning.</p>
<h2>2.5.A Issue - Insufficient Focus on Water Distribution Network Design</h2>
<p>The plan mentions a water distribution network but lacks critical details regarding hydraulic modeling, pressure management, and leakage control. Distributing water across a large rural area to 2 million people requires a sophisticated network design. The plan doesn't address how pressure will be maintained at adequate levels throughout the network, especially in areas with significant elevation changes. It also doesn't address how leakage will be minimized and detected. Leakage can account for significant water loss and revenue loss. The current plan is insufficient to ensure efficient and reliable water delivery.</p>
<h3>2.5.B Tags</h3>
<ul>
<li>Distribution</li>
<li>Hydraulics</li>
<li>Leakage</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5.C Mitigation</h3>
<p>Hire a hydraulic modeling expert to develop a detailed model of the water distribution network. This model should simulate water flow and pressure under various demand scenarios. Implement pressure reducing valves (PRVs) in areas with high pressure to minimize leakage and prevent pipe bursts. Incorporate district metering areas (DMAs) into the network design to facilitate leakage detection and management. Consult the ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) manual on water distribution system design. Provide the hydraulic modeling expert with detailed topographic data and anticipated water demand profiles for each service area.</p>
<h3>2.5.D Consequence</h3>
<p>Inadequate water pressure in some areas, excessive leakage, increased pumping costs, and potential pipe bursts.</p>
<h3>2.5.E Root Cause</h3>
<p>Underestimation of the complexity of water distribution in rural areas and lack of specialized expertise.</p>
<h2>2.6.A Issue - Inadequate Consideration of Long-Term Financial Sustainability</h2>
<p>The plan mentions a budget allocation for maintenance and operations, but it's unclear how the project will be financially sustainable in the long term. A one-time investment of $200 million is not enough. The project needs a sustainable revenue stream to cover ongoing operational costs, equipment replacements, and system upgrades. The plan doesn't address how water tariffs will be set, how revenue will be collected, or how the project will be protected from political interference. Without a clear financial sustainability plan, the project is likely to fail in the long run.</p>
<h3>2.6.B Tags</h3>
<ul>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Revenue</li>
<li>Tariffs</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6.C Mitigation</h3>
<p>Develop a detailed financial model that projects revenue and expenses over a 20-year period. Explore various revenue generation options, including water tariffs, connection fees, and government subsidies. Conduct a willingness-to-pay survey to determine the appropriate water tariff levels. Establish a transparent and accountable financial management system. Consult with a financial expert with experience in water utility management. Research successful models of community-based water management in similar rural areas. Provide the financial expert with detailed cost estimates for operation and maintenance.</p>
<h3>2.6.D Consequence</h3>
<p>Inability to cover operational costs, deterioration of infrastructure, and eventual project failure.</p>
<h3>2.6.E Root Cause</h3>
<p>Short-sighted focus on initial implementation and lack of consideration for long-term financial viability.</p>
